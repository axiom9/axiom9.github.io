								<p style="color: #331a00">I was initially introduced to the concept of data science in May 2020. I was rather unfamiliar with this term and a quick google search conveyed that it had to do with one of my toughest challenges; programming.
									<p style="color: #331a00"> After countless hours of pulling at my hair in frustration and coffee dates with my 'Python for dummies' guide at my local library, things finally clicked and the gears started turning!</p>
									<p style="color: #331a00"> I quickly came to love programming, as time passed I wanted to learn more and my love for artificial intelligence began to grow. I found it absolutely fascinating that one day, perhaps in the near future our lives can become very much intertwined with artificial intelligence. My goal is to work towards simplifying lives across the world by implementing artificial intelligence and using AI methods for analyzing big data to produce meaningful results that can directly impact the lives of others.</p>
									<p style = "color: #331a00"> One thing I'd want you to know about me is that I absolutely love learning. I feel that there is so much to learn in this field and I want to soak it all up like a dry sponge. This may sound odd, but you know the feeling you get after working hard all day? The feeling in your head that your brain is 'fatigued' from a long day... I love that feeling. I try to push myself every day so that I can feel that at the end of my day because I know that's the number one sign that I pushed myself to work hard that day, soaked in as much knowledge I can, and be the best version of myself.</p>

								<div class="box"><h2><p><center>Qualifications</center></p></h2>
									<p style="color: #331a00"> Throughout my undergraduate career I was involved in many organizations and committees. Currently I'm the President of Biomedical Engineering Society (Illinois Tech Student Chapter) and my involvement the past four years has not only allowed me to meet a group of amazing, passionate, and hard-working individuals that are going to be my lifelong friends, but has also played a momumental role in my professional development.</p>
									<p>________________________________________________________________________ </p>
									<p style="color: #331a00"> During summer 2021 I interned at Mayo Clinic in Rochester, Minnesota where I had the opportunity to work directly with healthcare providers in a clinical setting and assisted with two main projects: </p>
									<p style="color: #331a00">1. Assessing methods of characterizing bone ex vivo using the programmable Verasonics V-1 ultrasound platform and MATLAB for additional signal processing</p>
									<p style="color: #331a00"> 2. Utilizing TensorFlow alongside Keras (Python's deep learning API) to employ deep learning and aid in medical image processing.</p>
									<p>________________________________________________________________________ </p>
									<p style="color: #331a00">Currently I'm working part time at a start-up healthcare consulting company <a href="https://www.instraai.com/" target="_blank">(Instra.AI)</a> as a machine learning engineer. My duties consist of the development and maintenance of a data augmentation pipeline for various models, model training and optimizing, and data analysis. </p></div>
								
							
					

							
								<div class="box"><h2><p><center>Hobbies</center></p></h2>
									<p style="color: #331a00">When I'm not re-watching Breaking Bad for the thousandth time or sitting in the library on a coffee date with my school-work I love spending time in the gym, pushing myself to my absolute physical limits as well as my mental limits. Take a look at the following picture of me successfully deadlifting 315 pounds! To some professional lifters that might not seem like a lot, but personally it's been one of my goals for the longest time and I'm proud of accomplishing it despite my highs and lows. </p>

									<center><p style="color: #331a00">I'd like to end with one of my favorite quotes:</p></center>
								
									<blockquote>Never stop learning, because life never stops teaching.</blockquote> - Unknown
