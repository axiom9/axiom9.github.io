									<h2><a href="#">Project 1: City Classification (CNN) Model<br /></a></h2>
									<p>Developed a city classification model to classify a city into one of three major cities (Chicago, Miami, or New York)</p>
									<p>A major concern was data, I didn't want to go searching for hundreds or maybe thousands of feasible images to use in my classification model so I utilized a complex data augmentation pipeline to increase the amount of data that my model has to learn from - (work in progress)</p>
